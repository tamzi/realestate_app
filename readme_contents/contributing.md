Contributing to real estate App
===
I'd love to accept your patches!
To contribute to real estate App simply open a pull request against the [realestate_app develop branch](https://github.com/tamzi/realestate_app/tree/develop)

Ensure you have a develop branch before you place the link.

To ensure you that your pull request is accepted:

1. Describe your changes in the pull request description.
2. Be consistent with the coding style being used.
3. Make commits of logical units
4. Write descriptive commit messages and not 2 worded commits.
5. Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.



### NOTE
* Write tests:
  * new UI features should be added to the component_gallery.dart first.
  * changes to existing code should be reflected in the tests
  * run **all** the tests to assure nothing else in the project was accidentally broken.
